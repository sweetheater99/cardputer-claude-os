"""Claude Buddy for the M5 Cardputer-Adv.

This is a port of the Basic's `buddy_app.py` to a device with a QWERTY
matrix keyboard instead of three face buttons, a 240x135 LCD instead of
320x240, and no accessible battery IC (Cardputer-Adv ships with a
different power rail that we don't bother reading here). The wire
protocol, BLE stack, persistent state, and character-receive logic are
unchanged — we reuse `buddy_ble`, `buddy_protocol`, `buddy_state`, and
`buddy_chars` byte-for-byte from the Basic build. Only the I/O layer
(input → UI) is Cardputer-specific.

### Install layout

UIFlow 2.0's launcher shows any `*.py` inside `/flash/apps/` in its
"App List" menu. The peer modules go alongside this file in the same
directory, and we prepend `/flash/apps/` to sys.path on entry so
`import buddy_ble` etc. resolves. This keeps the whole bundle
self-contained in one folder — no touching /flash/ root, no clobbering
UIFlow's own main.py/boot.py.

### Input mapping

The Cardputer has a full keyboard, so we pick intuitive letters rather
than mimicking BtnA/B/C. The mapping is shown in the hint strip:

  Y / y / Enter   → approve once
  N / n           → deny
  Q / q / ESC     → quit back to the UIFlow App List

MatrixKeyboard.get_key() returns single-character strings for printable
keys and small integer codes for specials. We accept both forms for the
keys that have both — Enter (0x0D) and Escape (0x1B).

### Return-to-menu

UIFlow 2.0 has no return-to-launcher API; when a user app's `run()`
ends, the launcher does not repaint and the screen stays frozen on
whatever the app drew last. The established workaround (see
`hello_cardputer.py`) is to soft-reboot via `machine.reset()` on exit,
which lands the user back at the launcher automatically. We do that
here, in the `finally` block, *after* tearing BLE down cleanly.

#
# UIFlow 2.0's default sys.path on this build is roughly:
#   ['', '.frozen', '/lib', '/system', '/flash/libs']
# Notably /flash itself is NOT on the path, even though that's where
# boot.py and main.py live. We put the buddy_* peer modules at /flash/
# root (to keep them out of the App List, which scans /flash/apps/),
# and claude_buddy.py lives in /flash/apps/. Prepend both so imports
# resolve regardless of which layout a future install lands on.

# ---- battery stub
#
# The Basic's buddy_app.py talks to an IP5306 over I2C(0, sda=21,
# scl=22). The Cardputer-Adv has a completely different power
# architecture — there's no IP5306, and the battery/USB state lives in
# a chip we haven't wired up here. Stub the reader out so the protocol
# and UI layers still see the shape they expect; the footer will show
# "100%  USB" steady-state, which is a deliberate lie but a benign one.
# A follow-up can swap this for the real AXP2101/AW9523 reader once
# someone digs out the register map.

# ---- key adapter
#
# We translate the raw key from MatrixKeyboard into one of three
# intents: APPROVE / DENY / QUIT / None. That keeps the main loop dumb
# — it doesn't care which key was pressed, just what it means. Picking
# the mapping here (rather than sprinkling magic constants through the
# loop) also makes it trivial to add synonyms later (e.g. space = once).

def _intent_for_key(k):
    """Return an intent string or None for an unrecognized key.

    MatrixKeyboard.get_key() on this UIFlow 2.0 build hands back the
    raw ASCII byte value as an **int** — e.g. 0x59 for 'Y', 0x6E for
    'n', 0x0D for Enter, 0x1B for Escape. This is different from some
    older builds where it returned a length-1 string, so we accept
    both forms: ints in the printable range 0x20..0x7E are converted
    to their single-char string and then fall through to the string
    matcher below. That way we get one place that enumerates the
    key→intent map.

    The previous version of this function treated every int except
    0x0D / 0x1B as unknown, which silently dropped every Y/N/Q press
    — that's the "keyboard buttons don't work" symptom we saw on
    hardware.
